          <dt class="faq-title"><span>Q1.</span>What should I do If I have lost my Passport or Residence Card?</dt>
          <dd class="faq-detail">
            <span>A1.</span>
            <p>If you have lost your passport, you should undertake the following procedures:</p>
            <p class="indent"><span>1.</span>File a report on lost property with the nearest police office and obtain a certificate of theft or loss of the passport. </p>
            <p class="indent"><span>2.</span>By submitting this certificate and other documents to your country's Embassy in Japan, you will be able to have your passport (provisional passport/travel affidavit) re-issued.  </p>
            <p class="indent"><span>3.</span>n case your Residence Card is lost, stolen, or severely damaged, you need to re-apply for a new one at Immigration within 14 days of damaging or losing your card. If your card was lost or stolen, you first must go to the nearest police station (Koban) or police department to submit a "Report of Stolen Property" or "Report of Lost Articles." Please bring the report of loss/theft certificate issued by the police department with you when you go to Immigration.  </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="faq-title"><span>Q2.</span>What should I do when I move to another city/ward or Overseas?</dt>
          <dd class="faq-detail">
            <span>A2.</span>
            <p>You need to submit a “notification of moving-out” to your current ward/city office. Once you move into a new city, you need to submit a “notification of move-in” to your new ward/city office within 14 days of moving in. What you need to submit at that time are your Resident Card/Special Permanent Resident Certificate, and a “moving out notification certificate” that was issued at your former city/ward office. Changing your address in the same city/ward still requires a “notification of change of address” at your city/ward office within 14 days of your move.  <br>
              <br>
              When you move Overseas, you also need to submit a “notification of moving out” at your city office. In this case, however, no “certificate of moving out” will be issued to you. When you return to Japan with a reentry permit, you need a “notification of moving-in” within 14 days of your move after you set up a place to settle down. For this procedure, you will need your passport, your Resident Card. <br>
              Failure to comply with the above required procedures may result in penalties or the revocation of your resident status. </p>
          </dd>

            <p>Please refer to the online “Guidelines for Permission for Permanent Residence” provided by the Immigration Bureau and visit Foreign Employees Support Webpage- Visa Matters for complete details.</p>

              1)　Your behavior and conduct must be upright and proper, you must have no criminal record, perform civil duties, and live a problem-free life as a decent citizen. <br>
              2)　You have to have sufficient assets or ability to make an independent living, so as not to become a public burden, and are expected to live a stable life for the foreseeable future employing the assets or ability of yourself or those of your family members. <br>

          <dt class="faq-title"><span>Q4.</span>What will happen to my Unused Paid leaves?</dt>
          <dd class="faq-detail"><span>A4.</span><p>The right to annual paid leave expires after two years. In other words, annual paid leave left over from one year may be carried over and taken the next year only. For instance, if an employee is awarded 10 days' paid leave in 2020, but opts not to take paid leave in that year, the employee may carry those days over to 2021 and use them in addition to any leave days which become available in 2021. However, those 10 days awarded to the employee in 2020 cannot be carried over to 2022 or beyond.</p></dd>
          <dt class="faq-title"><span>Q5.</span>Can I drive using my International Driving License? </dt>
          <dd class="faq-detail"><span>A5.</span>Yes, Foreigners can drive in Japan with an International Driving Permit (IDP) for a maximum of one year, even if the IDP is valid for a longer period. After the one-year period, it is not possible to use an International Driving Permit again unless you return to your home country for at least three consecutive months in between.</dd>
