To prevent persons being identified by their numbers, the numbers are applied with no relation to identifiable factors such as home address or date of birth, etc. The My Number system offers several advantages. It helps realize a fairer and more just society as well enhances the convenience of the nation’s citizens. It also helps improve administrative efficiency.

        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          Every resident in Japan is required to pay taxes regardless of nationality. When roughly classified, there are the national taxes and local taxes.<br>
          Tax levied on one's income is roughly classified as Income Tax (Shotoku Zei), which is levied by the central government, and Resident Tax (Shimin Zei), which is levied by the prefecture or local government. These are paid separately. A foreign national is required to pay taxes the same as a Japanese national. <br>
          Income tax is withheld from their monthly salary. The bill for Resident Tax is posted by the prefecture or local government. Resident Tax is levied four times a year (Jun/Aug/Oct/Jan). <br>
          However, if you didn’t work in Japan the previous year, Resident Tax won’t be levied.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-subtitle">IncomeTax (所得税)</h3>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          Income tax is levied on a person's income for a year from January through December by the central government. For salaried workers, income tax is automatically withheld from their monthly salary. (This is called "withholding tax at the source" (gensen choshu), or "payroll deduction"(kyuryo tenbiki). Tax limits and rates vary depending on whether a foreigner is a resident or non -resident (a resident is one who has an address in Japan, or who has lived continuously in Japan for 1 year or more). Foreign residents are required to pay the same tax rates as ordinary Japanese. In principle, non- residents are required to pay a 20% tax on their income, unless they qualify for a tax exemption under a tax treaty.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Withholding Tax at the Source Statement (源泉徴収票 =Gensen Choshu hyo)</h3>
        <p class="section-desc">
          The withholding tax at the Source Statement indicates the amount of income tax you have paid from January through December of the stated year and is provided by one's employer by the end of January of the following year. If employment has been terminated, please get your Withholding Tax at the Source Statement from the previous employer. The Withholding Tax at the Source Statement is proof of payment of tax. Since it is required during application for renewal of one's resident status, year end adjustments and filing a tax return, it is important to keep it safe.
