          In Japan, there are different flushing methods depending on the type of toilet.<br>
          If it’s a tank type toilet, you can flush the toilet by using the handle to the side of the tank. In public facilities, traditional style Japanese toilets, or toilets that do not have a tank, you can flush the toilet by pulling the lever at the back of the toilet.<br>
          There are also models where the toilet can be flushed by pressing a button on the wall, or hovering your hand over a sensor. Like the image below<br>
          <br>
          Modern toilets flush automatically as soon as you get off the toilet seat

          In order to drown out the sound of you going about your business, there is a function that simulates the sound of flushing water. Sometimes this sound automatically starts playing when it detects that somebody has entered the cubicle. Other times, you might have to push a button to start the sound simulator

        <p class="section-desc _mb-m">
          For those who want to move out from the Dormitory, finding and renting an apartment can be a challenging task for Foreign employees, In this section we have provided what should bear in mind in case interested in finding an apartment.

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">I. Important Things to Remember about Renting an Apartment in Japan </h3>
        <p class="section-desc _bold">a. Initial Fees </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          Foreign employees may be taken by surprise when they learn about various kinds of (often expensive) initial fees required to be paid upfront when renting an apartment in Japan. Among the most common ones are: <br>
          1)Security deposit (shiki-kin, 敷金) - 0-2 months of rent <br>
          2)Key money (rei-kin, 礼金) - 0-2 months of rent <br>
          3)Agency commission fee (chukai tesuryo; 仲介手数料) - 0.5-1.5 months of rent <br>
          4)Fire insurance (15,000 yen for two years) - Rent for first month <br>
          <br>
          In addition to the list above, property owners may require other fees including the “key exchange fee,” which ranges from 10,000 to 30,000 yen. As such, it is strongly recommended to confirm what fees entail before making any decision.  
        </p>
        
        <p class="section-desc _bold">b. The Guarantor System </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          Besides the initial fees, another challenge that most foreign workers face in Japan is finding a guarantor (hosho-nin: 保証人) who can serve as the insurance for your contract with regard to rent and other damage costs. Landlords usually prefer a family member who resides in the country, if none other option could be the Company or a Japanese friend if agrees. If you couldn’t find the unit without the Guarantor requirement consult with HR if necessary.

        <p class="section-desc _bold">c. Terminology </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          ①The “R,” “L,” “D,” and “K” <br>
          In Japan, room layouts are often expressed in alphabetical abbreviations such as R (bedroom), L (living room), D (dining room), and K (kitchen area). A number to describe the number of bedrooms precedes the alphabetical letters as follows: <br>
          ●　1R – 1 bedroom with a kitchen unit in it (as also known as ‘studio’) <br>
          ●　1K – 1 bedroom with a separate kitchen area <br>
          ●　1DK – 1 bedroom with a dining and kitchen area <br>
          ●　1LDK – 1 bedroom with a living, dining, and kitchen area 
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          ②“Unit Bath” (unitto basu: ユニットバス) vs. “Separate Bath” (separeto basu or separeto: セパレート) <br>
          Japanese apartments have two types of bathrooms, “unit baths” and “separate baths.” Sometimes abbreviated to “UB,” a unit bath often comes with a toilet, a sink, and a bathtub in one space, which may sound familiar if you came from Western countries. In contrast, a “separate bath” means that the toilet and the bathtub are separate. Apartments with a “separate bath” tend to be more expensive. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          ③“Flooring” (furo-ringu: フローリング) <br>
          This term refers to wood flooring in contrast to Japanese-style tatami flooring. A Japanese room with tatami flooring is called washitsu (和室) while one with wood flooring is called youshitsu (洋室). 
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          ④“Jo” (帖 or 畳) <br>
          This term is the most commonly used unit of measure to describe the size of a room. Defined by the number of tatami mats, one unit equals 0.88 meters (2.89 feet) by 1.76 meters (5.77 feet) in the Kanto area including Yamanashi (Note: the size is slightly different in the Kansai area as well as the Nagoya area).

        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          It is customary to find an apartment through an agent in Japan and there are a number of websites that aggregate information about available apartments such as Suumo (<a href="http://suumo.jp" target="_blank">http://suumo.jp (Jap Only)</a>) and GaijinPot (<a href="https://apartments.gaijinpot.com/en/rent/listing" target="_blank">https://apartments.gaijinpot.com/en/rent/listing</a>). <br>

        <p class="section-desc _indent"><span class="fa fa-check"></span>Be sure to specify your needs and preferences (e.g. budget, location, floor plan, size, etc.). </p>

The written test is available in 11 languages: includes Russian English etc.</p>
        <p class="section-desc _bold">Step 5. Practice Driving Test </p>

The test is not usually given on the same day you apply; you will probably have to come back to the testing center. Most likely; it will be a testing block period, rather than a specific time. You may be able to change this schedule on the spot or over the phone later. (if possible to set up and make an appointment on the spot much better than calling, try to make an appointment for your driving test schedule before going home) <br>

        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          If you do not speak Japanese it may be difficult to get through these steps, and but not impossible. Most centers require that you bring someone with you who can speak Japanese. <br>
          <br>
          Depending on the driving center, you may be required to pay an additional car rental fee. Be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting. When your turn comes, you will be required to get in the car and drive the prescribed course with an examiner, who will speak only in Japanese. It is necessary to memorize all the turns and elements of the course in advance as you will not receive instructions from the proctor. <br>
          <br>
          If you make a “major” mistake you will fail on the spot. Whether or not you passed, you will be instructed to go inside and wait for the results with the other test takers. If you were not successful, you’ll be given a paper with your next scheduled opportunity to try again.<br>
          If you are successful, you should receive your new license that day.  This will entail paying fees, getting your picture taken, and filling out forms.<br>
          ※For the tips on the course of the driving test practice in japan, Youtube might be very helpful, there’s a lot of youtuber who also have an experienced converting their license to Japanese one and they uploaded the videos how to pass it.

        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          As much as possible, it’s convenient if you could look for a Driving School located nearby at the address shown on your resident card. <br>
          Here are the following guidelines when you go to Driving School in Japan. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc _bold">●Driving trainings are instructed individually</p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          Driving trainings are generally conducted individually on a one-on-one basis. <br>
          Each time your driving training is over, your weak points are logged and taken over to the next instructor. The following trainings will be customized and conducted individually based on your weak points. <br>
          In addition, according to the logged information, instructors can grasp the level of student’s driving ability and flexibly adjust the training menu and time allocation. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc _bold">●Academic classes are classroom style study</p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-m">
          Academic classes are classroom style study. Each lesson is 50min long and first 10min of the lesson is video learning. <br>
          Therefore, you may fall asleep during the class. Sometimes it is hard for you to maintain your motivation. <br>
          Also, it might be difficult to ask questions and resolve them on the fly. 
        </p>

        <p class="section-desc _bold _semi-large">(A) Flow of a Driving School Program</p>
        <p class="section-desc _bold">1, Enrollment Procedure</p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          Necessary things to bring for admission. The following 3 items are required for your enrollment procedure. Prepare them in advance. <br>
          > Resident’s card: You need an original, not a copy. <br>
          > Alien Registration Card: You need an original copy, not a copy.<br> 
          > Personal Seal <br>
          > Your eye glasses ( if you wear glasses) 
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc _indent _bold">Payment method </p>
        <p class="section-desc _indent">
          ・Lump-sum cash payment: Payment must be made by the day of entry. <br>
          ・Installment payments: Foreigners can apply for a loan, too. To apply for a loan, in principle, you must complete the payment during your stay in Japan and have to have some income (part-time job accepted). <br>
          ・Credit card: Usually not accepted. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc _indent _bold">Fees</p>
        <p class="section-desc _indent _mb-m">The fee will probably be around 200,000-300,000 JPY. Learning automatic is cheaper than manual. Textbooks and tests also cost money, though some driving schools include this in the price.</p>
        <p class="section-desc _bold">2, Aptitude test </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">A vision of 0.7(20/28vision in US) or more with both eyes is required to obtain a regular car license＊ Glasses and contact lenses are allowed to use for visual acuity test.</p>

          > 10 academic classes. <br>
          All the contents are about laws and regulation, including pedestrian protection and driving manners.
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc _indent">
          > Driving training consists of 12 classes for Automatic Transmission / 15 classes for Manual Transition to acquire basic driving skills. All the driving lessons will be held inside school, and the training car is equipped with the auxiliary brake. In case of danger, the instructor will assist you and hence there is almost no chance of an accident or injury.
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Greetings to your Neighbors</h3>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-m">
          In Japan, it is customary to greet your neighbors especially when you have moved to a new place. This is important because you can become acquainted with people that live in your area and they may also be a good source of information. <br>
          <br>
          Idea on how to interact with the neighbors varies with regions and people. It makes both parties feel good to exchange greetings when they meet. Say something like “OHAYOU GOZAIMASU” (good morning), “KONNICHIWA” (hello/good afternoon) or” KONNBANWA”(good evening) if you see your neighbor. A quick Bow or nod work too. 
          <br>
          Shoes are removed when entering households in Japan. They are left in the foyer and, in many cases, traded for house slippers. You are expected to remove them when entering a room with a tatami floor. Some public places such as schools and hospitals where there are a number of people using the facilities, however, may let you come inside with your outdoor shoes on or offer slippers to wear in place of shoes. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-subtitle">NOISES</h3>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">Noises in daily life can cause conflicts with your neighbors. Be careful not to make loud noises not only late at night and early in the morning, but also in daily life in general. Be careful with the volume on the television and radio, sounds of musical instruments, loud voices, noises from the vacuum cleaner and the washing machine, draining sounds of water during shower use and noises of opening and closing of doors. Be thoughtful and keep noises to a minimum at least after 9 pm.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">EARTHQUAKE</h3>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">Japan is a country that experiences numerous earthquakes. Many of the building in Japan are highly earthquake-resistant and safe. But if a major earthquake occurs that makes you fear for your safety, you should act in accordance with the following guideline.</p>

        <p class="section-desc _bold">1, When you are Indoors</p>
        <img src="assets/images/48earthquake1.JPG" alt="" class="l-img">
        <p class="section-desc _bold">2, When you are Outdoors</p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">An earthquake can cause objects to topple, glass to shatter and fly, and walls and hillsides to collapse, so cover your head and stay away from buildings and danger zones.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/49earthquake2.JPG" alt="" class="m-img">
        <p class="section-desc _bold">3, When you are in a Tall Building</p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          It is too dangerous to evacuate immediately from a tall building. It’s definitely safer to stay inside and cover your head to protect yourself from falling objects. Stay away from the windows and heavy furniture.<br>
          Do not use elevators, as they may lose power in a blackout. Keeping calm and avoiding panic are the keys to staying safe during an earthquake.
