          In Japan, there are different flushing methods depending on the type of toilet.<br>
          If it’s a tank type toilet, you can flush the toilet by using the handle to the side of the tank. In public facilities, traditional style Japanese toilets, or toilets that do not have a tank, you can flush the toilet by pulling the lever at the back of the toilet.<br>
          There are also models where the toilet can be flushed by pressing a button on the wall, or hovering your hand over a sensor. Like the image below<br>
          <br>
          Modern toilets flush automatically as soon as you get off the toilet seat

          In order to drown out the sound of you going about your business, there is a function that simulates the sound of flushing water. Sometimes this sound automatically starts playing when it detects that somebody has entered the cubicle. Other times, you might have to push a button to start the sound simulator

        <p class="section-desc _mb-m">
          For those who want to move out from the Dormitory, finding and renting an apartment can be a challenging task for Foreign employees, In this section we have provided what should bear in mind in case interested in finding an apartment.

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">I. Important Things to Remember about Renting an Apartment in Japan </h3>
        <p class="section-desc _bold">a. Initial Fees </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          Foreign employees may be taken by surprise when they learn about various kinds of (often expensive) initial fees required to be paid upfront when renting an apartment in Japan. Among the most common ones are: <br>
          1)Security deposit (shiki-kin, 敷金) - 0-2 months of rent <br>
          2)Key money (rei-kin, 礼金) - 0-2 months of rent <br>
          3)Agency commission fee (chukai tesuryo; 仲介手数料) - 0.5-1.5 months of rent <br>
          4)Fire insurance (15,000 yen for two years) - Rent for first month <br>
          <br>
          In addition to the list above, property owners may require other fees including the “key exchange fee,” which ranges from 10,000 to 30,000 yen. As such, it is strongly recommended to confirm what fees entail before making any decision.  
        </p>
        
        <p class="section-desc _bold">b. The Guarantor System </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          Besides the initial fees, another challenge that most foreign workers face in Japan is finding a guarantor (hosho-nin: 保証人) who can serve as the insurance for your contract with regard to rent and other damage costs. Landlords usually prefer a family member who resides in the country, if none other option could be the Company or a Japanese friend if agrees. If you couldn’t find the unit without the Guarantor requirement consult with HR if necessary.

        <p class="section-desc _bold">c. Terminology </p>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          ①The “R,” “L,” “D,” and “K” <br>
          In Japan, room layouts are often expressed in alphabetical abbreviations such as R (bedroom), L (living room), D (dining room), and K (kitchen area). A number to describe the number of bedrooms precedes the alphabetical letters as follows: <br>
          ●　1R – 1 bedroom with a kitchen unit in it (as also known as ‘studio’) <br>
          ●　1K – 1 bedroom with a separate kitchen area <br>
          ●　1DK – 1 bedroom with a dining and kitchen area <br>
          ●　1LDK – 1 bedroom with a living, dining, and kitchen area 
        </p>

          ②“Unit Bath” (unitto basu: ユニットバス) vs. “Separate Bath” (separeto basu or separeto: セパレート) <br>
          Japanese apartments have two types of bathrooms, “unit baths” and “separate baths.” Sometimes abbreviated to “UB,” a unit bath often comes with a toilet, a sink, and a bathtub in one space, which may sound familiar if you came from Western countries. In contrast, a “separate bath” means that the toilet and the bathtub are separate. Apartments with a “separate bath” tend to be more expensive.

          ③“Flooring” (furo-ringu: フローリング) <br>
          This term refers to wood flooring in contrast to Japanese-style tatami flooring. A Japanese room with tatami flooring is called washitsu (和室) while one with wood flooring is called youshitsu (洋室).

          ④“Jo” (帖 or 畳) <br>
          This term is the most commonly used unit of measure to describe the size of a room. Defined by the number of tatami mats, one unit equals 0.88 meters (2.89 feet) by 1.76 meters (5.77 feet) in the Kanto area including Yamanashi (Note: the size is slightly different in the Kansai area as well as the Nagoya area).

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">How to Find an Apartment</h2>
        <p class="section-desc _mb-s">
          It is customary to find an apartment through an agent in Japan and there are a number of websites that aggregate information about available apartments such as Suumo (<a href="http://suumo.jp" target="_blank">http://suumo.jp (Jap Only)</a>) and GaijinPot (<a href="https://apartments.gaijinpot.com/en/rent/listing" target="_blank">https://apartments.gaijinpot.com/en/rent/listing</a>). <br>
          Here is a summary of the steps to take: 
        </p>
        <p class="section-desc">1. Contact an agent(s) and make an appointment; however, walk-ins are often accepted as well. </p>
        <p class="section-desc _indent"><span class="fa fa-check"></span>Be sure to specify your needs and preferences (e.g. budget, location, floor plan, size, etc.). </p>
        <p class="section-desc">2. Schedule an apartment-viewing day. </p>
        <p class="section-desc">3. Review a contract and negotiate the initial fees if possible. </p>
        <p class="section-desc _indent"><span class="fa fa-check"></span>Monthly rent and key money are sometimes negotiable (particularly in the off-season: May – August). </p>
        <p class="section-desc">4. Decide on a move-in date and sign the contract. </p>
        <p class="section-desc">5. Check with the agent about how to have utilities set up. </p>
        <p class="section-desc _indent"><span class="fa fa-check"></span>You will most likely have to call the gas company and arrange for an appointment individually). </p>
